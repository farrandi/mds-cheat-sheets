# Platforms Cheat Sheet

## Shell

- `ls` - list files and directories. Default behavior is to list the contents of the current working directory.
- `cd` - change directory. Used to navigate the filesystem. Default behavior is to change to the home directory.
- `pwd` - print working directory. It will return the absolute path of the current working directory.
- `mkdir` - make directory
- `touch` - create file
- `rm` - remove file
- `rmdir` - remove directory
- `mv` - move file. also used to rename file.
- `cp` - copy file
- `which` - locate a program. It will return the path of the program.

### Flags

These flags allow us to modify the default behaviour of a program.

- `-a` - all
- `-l` - long
- `-h` - human readable
- `-r` - recursive
- `-f` - force

### Directories

- `.` - current directory
- `..` - parent directory
- `~` - home directory
- `/` - root directory

| Command-line interface (CLI)   | A user interface that relies solely on text for commands and output, typically running in a shell.                                                                                    |
| Operating system               | A program that provides a standard interface to whatever hardware it is running on.                                                                                                   |
| Filesystem                     | The part of the operating system that manages how files are stored and retrieved. Also used to refer to all of those files and directories or the specific way they are stored.       |
| Subdirectory                   | A directory that is below another directory                                                                                                                                           |
| Parent directory               | The directory that contains another directory of interest. Going from a directory to its parent, then its parent, and so on eventually leads to the root directory of the filesystem. |
| Home directory                 | A directory that contains a user’s files.                                                                                                                                             |

## Git and Github

- `git init` - initialize a git repository
- `git add` - add files to staging area.
  - Staging area is a place where we can group files together before we "commit" them to git.
- `git commit` - commit changes to git. Records a new version of the files in the repository.
- `git push` - push changes to remote repository from local repository
- `git pull` - pull changes from remote repository to local repository
- `git status` - check status of git repository
- `git log` - check commit history
  - `git log --oneline` - check commit history in one line
  - `git log -p` - check commit history with changes
- `git diff` - check difference between two commits
- `git reset` - reset git repository
  - `git reset --hard` - reset git repository to last commit
  - `git reset --soft` - reset git repository to last commit but keep changes
- `git revert` - revert git repository. The difference between revert and reset is that revert creates a new commit with the changes from the commit we want to revert.
- `git stash` - saves changes that you don't want to commit immediately. It takes the dirty state of your working directory — that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes — and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.

### Common Terms

- Repository - a collection of files and folders that are tracked by git.
- Commit - a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time.
- Commit Hash - These are the commits’ hashes (SHA-1), which are used to uniquely identify the commits within a project.
- Branch - a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

### Public and Private Keys

- Public key is used to encrypt data and private key is used to decrypt data.

- Confidentiality - only the intended recipient can decrypt the data.
- Authentication - only the intended recipient can encrypt the data.

### SSH vs HTTPS

SSH is more secure than HTTPS because it uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data.
HTTPS uses username and password to authenticate users.

## Quarto and Github Pages

Github pages will look in either the repository root / directory or in the repository docs/ directory for website content to render.

## Dynamic Documents

- **Dynamic Documents**: Rooted in Knuth's "literate programming" concept from 1984.
- **Main Goals**:
  - Write program code.
  - Create narratives to elucidate code function.
- **Benefits**:
  - Enhances understanding and provides comprehensive documentation.
  - Gives a way to run code and view results.
  - Allows text and code to be combined in a single document.
  - Facilitates reproducibility of results and diagrams.
- **Popular Formats**:
  - Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
  - RMarkdown documents (.Rmd)
- **Key Features**:
  - Narratives formatted with markdown.
  - Executable code:
    - Interwoven in text (RMarkdown's inline code).
    - Separate sections: code cells (Jupyter) or code chunks (RMarkdown).

## RSudio and Quarto

### RStudio Basics

| Function       | Description                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getwd()`      | Returns the current working directory of the R session.                                                                      |
| `setwd(path)`  | Changes the working directory to the specified `path`.                                                                       |
| `here::here()` | Creates file paths relative to the project's root (where the `.Rproj` file is) to ensure consistent and portable references. |

**Note**: For portability, prefer `here::here()` over `setwd()` to avoid path inconsistencies across different systems.

### RStudio code chunks

Global looks like this:

````

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

### RMarkdown Templates

- On top of the RMarkdown document, you can specify a template.
- Templates are `.Rmd` files that contain the YAML header and some default text.

```
---
title: "Untitled"
output: github_document / html_document / pdf_document / word_document
author: "farrandi"
date: "10/2/2023"
---
```

### Basic Quarto presentation:

```
# Same YAML header as above
---
title: "521 Quiz 2"
author: "Daniel Chen"
format: revealjs
---

# In the morning

## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed

## Breakfast

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee

# In the evening

## Dinner

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep
```

## Presentations in JupyterLab

- JupyterLab supports presentations using the JavaScript framework: `reveal.js`.
- `reveal.js` is the same framework used by Quarto.
- Cells for presentations are marked via the property inspector:
  - Found at the settings wheel in the left side panel.
  - Select slide type from the dropdown menu.
- `reveal.js` presentations are two dimensional:
  - Horizontal slides
  - Vertical sub-slides

### Slide Types and Navigation

| Slide Type   | Description                                        | Navigation                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Slide        | Standard slide                                     | Left and right arrows     |
| Sub-slide    | Sub-topic of a slide                               | Up and down arrows        |
| Fragment     | Animated part of the previous slide, e.g. a bullet | Part of slide animation   |
| - (or empty) | Appears in same cell as previous slide             | Part of slide             |
| Notes        | Speaker notes                                      | Visible when pressing 't' |
| Skip         | Not included in the presentation                   | -                         |

### Image Inclusion Workaround

- Images using `![]()` or `<img>` tags don't show up in exports.
- Workaround: Paste images into a Markdown cell to include them as attachments. This ensures visibility in HTML and slide exports.

## Virtual Environments

- **Virtual Environments**: Isolated Python environments that allow for the installation of packages without affecting the system's Python installation.
- **Benefits**:
  - Isolation: Packages installed in a virtual environment are isolated from the system's Python installation.
  - Reproducibility: Virtual environments can be shared with others to ensure reproducibility.
  - Version control: Allow managing the versions of libraries and tools used in a project.
  - Cross-platform: Ensures that the project's dependencies are consistent across different systems.
  - Experimentation: Allows for experimentation with different versions of packages.
  - Clean environment: When starting a new project, starts with a clean slate.
  - Consistency: Ensures that the project's dependencies are consistent across different systems.
  - Security: Isolates the project's dependencies from the system's Python installation.

### Python: Conda

- `conda create -n <env_name> python=<version>`: create a new environment
  - `conda env create -f path/to/environment.yml`: create an environment from a file
  - `conda create --name live_env --clone test_env`: create an environment from an existing environment
- `conda env list`: list all environments
- `conda activate <env_name>`: activate the environment
- `conda deactivate`: deactivate the environment
- `conda remove -n <env_name> --all`: remove the environment
- `conda env export -f environment.yml --from-history`: export the environment to a file
  - `--from-history`: only include packages that were explicitly installed

Managing packages:

- `conda config --add channels conda-forge`: add a channel
- `conda list`: list all packages in the environment
- `conda search <package>`: search for a package
- `conda install <package>`: install a package
  - `conda install <package>=<version>`: install a specific version of a package
- `conda remove <package>`: remove a package

Example `environment.yml` file:

```
name: test_env
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - conda
  - python=3.7
  - pandas==1.0.2
  - jupyterlab
```

| Component        | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **name**         | - Identifies the environment's name. <br>- Useful for distinguishing multiple environments.                                         |
| **channels**     | - Locations where Conda searches for packages. <br>- Default: `defaults` channel. <br>- Popular options: `conda-forge`, `bioconda`. |
| **dependencies** | - Lists required packages for the environment. <br>- Can specify versions or ranges. <br>- Can include Conda or pip packages.       |
| **prefix**       | - (Optional) Directory where Conda installs the environment. <br>- Defaults to Conda's main directory if not provided.              |

### R: renv

1. Make a new project in RStudio
   1.1. Select setting to use renv
   1.2. `library(renv)`: to use renv
2. `renv::init()`: initialize the project

## File names

3 Principles:

1. Machine readable:

   - regex and globbing friendly (avoid spaces, special characters, case sensitivity, etc.)
   - deliberate use of delimiters (e.g. `_`, `-`, `.`)

2. Human readable: Helps other people and ourselves in the future quickly understand the
   file structure and contents of a project/ file.

3. Plays well with default ordering: Makes files more organized and easily searchable. Easy
   for us humans to find the files we are looking for.

   - Dates go: `YYYY-MM-DD`

## Asking Questions

1. Reproducible example
2. Code formatting
3. Minimal, complete, verifiable example

**Effective Questioning & Creating an MRE**:

- Search for similar questions before asking.
- Clearly state the problem in the title and provide brief details in the body.
- Provide the shortest version of your code that replicates the error.
- Include definitions if you've used functions or classes.
- Use toy datasets rather than real data.
- Use markdown for code to ensure readability and syntax highlighting.
- Share attempts, points of confusion, and full error tracebacks.

## Regex
