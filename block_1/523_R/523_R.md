- `read_delim(url, delim = "")`: reads a file with a delimiter

### readxl Package

- `read_excel(file_path, sheet="name")`: reads an excel file
  - to read url need to do `download.file(url, destfile = "file.xlsx", mode = "wb")`

### janitor Package

- `clean_names(df)`: cleans column names to match them with R conventions (e.g., col_name1)

### dplyr Package

- `select(df, col_name1, col_name2)`: selects cols
- `filter(df, col_name1 == "value", col_name2 > 5)`: filters rows
  - `filter(df, col_name1 %in% c("value1", "value2"))`: filters if col_name1 is in a vector of values
- `arrange(df, col_name1)`: sorts rows, default is ascending
  - `arrange(df, desc(col_name1))`: sorts rows descending
- `mutate(df, new_col_name = col_name1 + col_name2)`: creates new cols
- `slice(df, 1:10)`: selects rows
  - `slice(df, 1)`: selects first row
- `pull(df, col_name1)`: extracts a column as a vector

### stringr Package

- `str_detect(df$col_name, "value")`: detects if a string contains a value
- `str_subset(df$col_name, "value")`: subsets a string if it contains a value
- `str_split(df$col_name, "value")`: splits a string by a value
  - `str_split_fixed(df$col_name, "value", n)`: splits a string by a value and returns n columns (gets character matrix)
- `separate(df, col_name, into = c("new_col_name1", "new_col_name2"), sep = "value")`: separates a column into two columns
- `str_length(df$col_name)`: gets length of string
- `str_sub(df$col_name, start = n, end = m)`: gets substring from n to m
- `str_c(df$col_name1, df$col_name2, sep = "value")`: concatenates two strings
  - `str_c(df$col_name1, sep = "value", collapse = "value")`: concatenates vector of string and collapses them into one string
- `str_replace(df$col_name, "value", "new_value")`: replaces a value in a string

### forcats Package

- `fct_drop(df$col_name)`: drops unused levels
- `fct_infreq(df$col_name)`: orders levels by frequency
- `fct_reorder(df$col_name, df$col_name2)`: orders levels by another column
- `fct_relevel(df$col_name, "value")`: moves a level to the front
- `fct_rev(df$col_name)`: reverses order of levels

### tidyr Package

- `pivot_longer(df, cols = c(col_name1, col_name2), names_to = "new_col_name", values_to = "new_col_name")`: pivots cols to rows
- `pivot_wider(df, names_from = "col_name1", values_from = "col_name2")`: pivots rows to cols

### Tidy data

Criteria:

1. Each row is a single observation
2. Each variable is a single column
3. Each value is a single cell

## Assignment environment

we use `<-` to assign values to variables.

This is because when we do `median(x <- c(1, 2, 3))` `x` is assigned to `c(1, 2, 3)` globally.

### Vectors

- objects that contain 1 or more elements of the same type
- elements are ordered
- Heirarchy for coercion: character > double > integer > logical
- to change type of vector use `as.character()`, `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, `as.logical()`
- to check if vector is of a certain type use `is.character()`, `is.double()`, `is.integer()`, `is.logical()`
- to check length of vector use `length()`
- to check type of vector use `typeof()`

Can get vector from df using: `df$col_name`

#### Subsetting

<img src="img/indexing.png" width=600>

```r
name <- c("a", "b", "c")
name[1] # "a"
name[2:3] # "b" "c"
name[-1] # "b" "c"
name[length(name)] # "c"]

# Also...
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- x

y[3] <- 4
y
#> [1] 1 2 4
```

## Tibbles vs Data Frames

Tibles inherit from data frames but are more strict. They are more consistent and have better printing.

Important properties:

1. Tibbles only output first 10 rows and all columns that fit on screen
2. when you subset a tibble you always get a tibble, in data frames you get a vector

## Dates and Times

uses lubridate package

- `today()`: gets today's date, class is Date
- `now()`: gets today's date and time, class is POSIXct
- `ymd(), ydm(), mdy(), myd(), dmy(), dym()`: converts character to date
- `ymd_hms()`: converts character to date and time
- Can mutate date: `dates |> mutate = make_date(year, month, day)`
- `wdays()`: gets day of week
  - `wdays(date, label = TRUE)`: gets abbreviated day of week (e.g., Mon)
  - `wday(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)`: gets day of week as full name (e.g., Monday)
- `mdays()`: gets day of month
- `ydays()`: gets day of year

## Joining Data

- `bind_rows(df1, df2)`: binds rows of two dfs
- `bind_cols(df1, df2)`: binds cols of two dfs

- `inner_join(df1, df2, by = "col_name")`: joins two dfs by col_name, only keeps rows that match
- `left_join(df1, df2, by = "col_name")`: joins two dfs by col_name, keeps all rows from df1
- `semi_join(df1, df2, by = "col_name")`: joins two dfs by col_name, keeps only column names from df1, only keeps rows that match
- `anti_join(df1, df2, by = "col_name")`: joins two dfs by col_name, keeps only column names from df1, keeps only rows that don't match
- `full_join(df1, df2, by = "col_name")`: joins two dfs by col_name, keeps all rows from both dfs

## Change or Remove Specific Values

### Selectively Change Values

- `case_when()`: selectively modify column values based on conditions

```r
gapminder |>
    mutate(country = case_when(country == "Cambodia" ~ "Kingdom of Cambodia",
    # only work if country is character (not factor)
                            TRUE ~ country))

# For multiple values
gapminder |>
    mutate(continent = case_when(continent == "Asia" ~ "Asie",
                                 continent == "Europe" ~ "L'Europe",
                                 continent == "Africa" ~ "Afrique",
                                 TRUE ~ continent)) #This is to keep the original value (not NA)
```

### Removing Rows with NAs

| Command     | Description                            | Example               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `drop_na()` | Remove rows based on NA in cols x to y | `df %>% drop_na(x:y)` |
|             | Remove rows if any column has NA       | `df %>% drop_na()`    |

## Iterate over groups of rows

- `summarise()` or `summarize()`: returns a single value for each group
- `group_by()`: groups rows by a column

```r
# calculate the average life expectancy for the entire dataset
gapminder |>
    summarise(mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp))

# calculate the average life expectancy for each continent and year
gapminder |>
    group_by(continent, year) |>
    summarise(mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE))
    # na.rm = TRUE removes NAs from calculation

# does not collapse the data frame, compute with group
gapminder %>%
    group_by(country) %>%
    mutate(life_exp_gain = lifeExp - first(lifeExp)) %>%
    # first() returns the first value of a vector
    head()
```

## purrr Package

<img src="img/5_purrr_map.png" width=400>

- `map(df, mean, na.rm = TRUE)`: retuirns a list
  - `na.rm = TRUE` removes NAs from calculation
- `map_dfc(df, median)`: returns a tibble
- `map_dbl(df, max)`: returns a double vector

Can use anonymous functions with `map()`:

```r
# Long form
map_*(data, function(arg) function_being_called(arg, other_arg))
# e.g.
map_df(data_entry, function(vect) str_replace(vect, pattern = "Cdn", replacement = "Canadian"))

# short form
map_*(data, ~ function_being_called(., other_arg))
# e.g.
map_df(data_entry, ~str_replace(., pattern = "Cdn", replacement = "Canadian"))
```

## Functions

- Has roxygen comments, same as python docstrings

```r
#' Calculates the variance of a vector of numbers.
#'
#' Calculates the sample variance of data generated from a normal/Gaussian distribution,
#' omitting NA's in the data.
#'
#' @param data numeric vector of numbers whose length is > 1.
#'
#' @return numeric vector of length one, the variance.
#'
#' @examples
#' variance(c(1, 2, 3))
variance <- function(observations) {
  if (!is.numeric(observations)) {
    # Throws an error
    stop("All inputs must be numeric.")
  }
  sum((observations - mean(observations)) ^ 2) / (length(observations) - 1)
}
```

- Name Masking: if a variable is defined in the function, it will be used instead of the global variable
  - if not in function, looks one level up, until it reaches the global environment
- R looks for values when the function is run, not when it is defined
- Each run is independent of the other
- Lazy Evaluation: R only evaluates the arguments that are needed
  - `force()` forces R to evaluate an argument

### Testing with `testthat`

- `test_that("Message to print if test fails", expect_*(...))`

```r
test_that('variance expects a numeric vector', {
    expect_error(variance(list(1, 2, 3)))
    expect_error(variance(data.frame(1, 2, 3)))
    expect_error(variance(c("one", "two", "three")))
})
```

|                   | - `expect_equal(x, y, tolerance = 0.00001)`                                                            |
| expect_equivalent | Compare R objects x and y testing ‘near equality’ (can set a tolerance) and does not assess attributes |

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `source("path/to/script.R")` | Take functions from another script |
| `library(package_name)`      | Import a package                   |

### Anonymous Functions

`(function(x) x + 1)(1)`
(see purrr package for examples)

## Nested Data Frames

```r
# create a nested data frame
by_country <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, country) %>%
    nest() # turns all other columns into a column called data (list of data frames)
```

Common workflow:

1. `group_by()` + `nest()` to create a nested data frame
2. `mutate()` + `map()` to add new columns
3. `unnest()` to return to a regular data frame

```r
weather |>
# step 1
  group_by(origin, month) |>
  nest() |>
# step 2
  mutate(min_temp = map_dbl(data, ~min(.$temp, na.rm = T)),
         max_temp = map_dbl(data, ~max(.$temp, na.rm = T)),
         avg_temp = map_dbl(data, ~mean(.$temp, na.rm = T)))
# step 3
unnest(avg_temp) # only unnest if we get some intermediate list-columns from map
```

Alternative to above code:

```r
weather_nested_2 <- weather |>
  group_by(origin, month) |>
  summarise(min_temp = min(temp, na.rm = T),
            max_temp = max(temp, na.rm = T),
            avg_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = T))
```

## Tidy Evaluation

metaprogramming: writing code that writes code

With tidyverse, they have a feautre called "non-standard evaluation" (NSE). Part of this is data masking.

- Data Masking: data frame is promised to be first argument (data mask)
  - columns act as if they are variables, `filter(gapminder, country == "Canada", year == 1952)`
  - checks dataframe first before global environment
- Delay in Evaluation: expressions are captured and evaluated later

- `enquo()`: quotes the argument
- `sym()`: turns column name into a function as a string
- `!!`: unquotes the argument
- `{{ arg_name }}`: unquotes and quotes the argument
- `:=`: Walrus operator - needed when assigning values

```r
# e.g.
filter_gap <- function(col, val) {
    col <- enquo(col)
    filter(gapminder, !!col == val)
}

# better way
filter_gap <- function(col, val) {
    filter(gapminder, {{col}} == val)
}

filter_gap(country, "Canada")
```

```r
# e.g. of walrus operator
function(data, group, col, fun) {
    data %>%
        group_by({{ group }}) %>%
        summarise( {{ col }} := fun({{ col }}))
}
```

### Passing dots

- if passing varibales to tidyverse functions, use `...`
  - when variable not used in logical comparisons or variable assignment
    - should be last argument in function
    - can add multiple arguments

```r
sort_gap <- function(x, ...) {
    print(x + 1)
    arrange(gapminder, ...)
}

sort_gap(1, year, continent, country)
```
